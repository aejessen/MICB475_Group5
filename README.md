# 7 Feb 2024 Meeting Agenda
1. Discuss our research question options:
   Our main idea for our research question: Are the gut microbiomes of male and female infants with or without anemia differentially affected by diet?
   Our back up ideas:
   - Looking at anemia and gut microbiomes of stunted infants vs non stunted infants
   - Looking at the microbiomes of infants with anemia delivered via C section or vaginal birth (Note: will have to combine data sets)
2. Is this feasible? Have other teams done this before?
3. Discuss team proposal plans
4. Ask Evelyn about documentation procedures
